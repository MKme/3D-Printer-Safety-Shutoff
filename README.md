V1 Using MQ2 Smoke sensor digital output and a DHT 11 Temp sensor to monitor the temp inside the printing chamber
If the temp gets higher than DHT limit or smoke is triggered the relay will be de-energized shutting off the power to your printer
NOTE DHT11 only goodf to 50C so use this outside your printer and add a high temp thermistor etc inside the chamber.
